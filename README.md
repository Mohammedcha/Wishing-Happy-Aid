<strong>Wishing Happy Aid</strong> is a small web application coded in <code>HTML</code>, <code>PHP</code>, <code>JS</code>, and <code>CSS</code>. We also used some PNG images and some effects to make the page attractive.

So when people start sharing the page with friends and next to their friends with their friends, the page will spread and become Viral.

If you want to earn from festival sessions then you can use <strong>Wishing Happy Aid</strong> script.

<h1>Settings</h1>

You can modify the script and change everything you want by modifying it in <code>config.php</code>

You will find some explanations in Arabic to help you understand the script variables easier.. :blush:

You will find the attached pictures folder .. <code>assets</code>


This folder contains all images associated with the script.

You can change the images <strong>without changing their size (image dimensions)</strong>


<h2>Adsense settings</h2>

<b>For Adsense topic ..</b>
You will notice the presence of only <code>2</code> ad units in the <code>config.php</code> file .. </br>
While <code>4</code> units will appear in the front of the site, ( <i>because each ad unit repeated twice</i> ).


<h4>Small ad units :</h4>
You can change the small ad unit from here :
<pre>
$small_ads_id = "ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
$small_ads_slot = "XXXXXXXXXX";
</pre>

<b>If the ad unit number is left blank, the 2 small ads will not fade on the website</b>

<h4>Large ad units :</h4>

You can change the large ad unit from here :

<pre>
$big_ads_id = "ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
$big_ads_slot = "XXXXXXXXXX";
</pre>

<b>If the ad unit number is left blank, the 2 large ads will not fade on the website</b>

<pre>
<b>I advise you to start with one ad unit at the beginning in order to protect your advertising account.</b>
<b>You can choose the small ad unit and after the first batch you can run the large units.</b>
</pre>
