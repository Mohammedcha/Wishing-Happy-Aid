<h2>Google Adsense Ad Unit</h2>

<b>For Adsense topic ..</b>
You will notice the presence of only <code>2</code> ad units in the <code>config.php</code> file .. </br>
While <code>4</code> units will appear in the front of the site, ( <i>because each ad unit repeated twice</i> ).

<h4>Small ad units :</h4>
You can change the small ad unit from here :
<pre>
$small_ads_id = "ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
$small_ads_slot = "XXXXXXXXXX";
</pre>
<i>If the ad unit number is left blank, the two small ads will not fade on the site</i>

<h4>Large ad units :</h4>
You can change the large ad unit from here :
<pre>
$big_ads_id = "ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
$big_ads_slot = "XXXXXXXXXX";
</pre>
<i>If the ad unit number is left blank, the two large ads will not be defeated</i>

<pre>
<b>
I advise you to start with one ad unit at the beginning in order to protect your advertising account.
You can choose the small ad unit and after the first batch you can run the large units.
